				<p>Imagine heading home from high school... but you have no home. Up to 10 teens at each local suburban high school have no place to sleep at night. Teen homelessness is a problem in the suburbs, too.</p>

				<p>The Open Hands Foundation is partnering with <a href="bridgeforyouth.org/">The Bridge for Youth</a> to create a new shelter for teenage kids in southwestern Twin Cities area. The goal of this partnership is that no youth in the community should be without a safe, stable place to sleep at night. With your help, they will be opening a shelter for teens in crisis in Fall of 2015. Westwood Community Church has donated a home and all maintenance costs. The Bridge for Youth will provide all services for youth, including:</p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>24-hour crisis hotline</li>
				<li>Emergency shelter for youth ages 10-17</li>
				<li>Walk-in and by-appointment counseling for youth, parents, and families</li>
				<li>Drop-in teen health clinic</li>
				<li>Weekly, drop-in support groups</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>The Bridge4Hope&trade; goal is to raise $10,000 in donor contributions to support the Open Hands Foundation's important work. All you have to do is fill out the form below! And remember &mdash; for every dollar you give, Bridge4Hope&trade; will double your impact by matching your donation.</p>

				<p>Let's build a bridge to reach our neighbors in need!</p>
