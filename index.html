				<p>Imagine heading home from high schoolâ€¦ but you have no home. Up to 10 teens at each local suburban high school have no place to sleep at night. We often think of homelessness as something we find in more urban areas, but kids are homeless in suburbs, too.</p>

				<p>Via the fundraising project, Bridge4Hope&trade; will be supporting a partnership between the <a target="_blank" href="https://givemn.org/organization/openhandsfoundation">Open Hands Foundation</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://bridgeforyouth.org/">The Bridge for Youth</a> to create "Hope House" &mdash; a new shelter and crisis center for teenage kids in the southwestern Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The goal of this partnership is that <b>no youth in the community should be without a safe, stable place to sleep at night</b>. With your help, they will be opening Hope House in Fall of 2015. The Bridge for Youth will provide all services for youth, including:</p>

				<p>24-hour crisis hotline
				Emergency shelter for youth ages 10-17
				Walk-in and by-appointment counseling for youth, parents, and families
				Drop-in teen health clinic
				Weekly, drop-in support groups</p>

				<p>The Bridge4Hope&trade; objective is to raise $10,000 in donor contributions to support the important work of Hope House -- and each donation will be matched dollar for dollar up to up to $10,000 by Bridge4Hope&trade;.</p>

				<p>We invite you to join us in supporting <b>the effort to provide a safe place for homeless teens to sleep and receive supportive services</b>. And remember &mdash; for every dollar you give, Bridge4Hope&trade; will double your impact by matching your donation.</p>

				<p>Let's build a bridge to reach our neighbors in need and make a difference in their lives!</p>
